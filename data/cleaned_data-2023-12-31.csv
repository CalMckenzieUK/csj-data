We are making substantial investments in new digital technologies and skills to enhance our regulatory processes and management of information.ONR offers a competitive salary and an excellent pension and one of the most rewarding jobs in the public sector.The Nuclear Safety Inspector Role – Human FactorsNuclear Inspectors are expected to be capable of undertaking a variety of roles: Inspecting sites Assessing technical safety cases Enforcing the law and influencing improvement in safety cases Investigating incidents; Developing strategic approaches to secure high standards in the industry Managing nuclear research contracts etcThe role of a Nuclear Inspector is varied and you are likely to undertake a range of duties during your career. Some Inspectors concentrate on undertaking planned and reactive inspections on site, while others will mainly assess safety submissions or manage discrete intervention projects.\xa0Our Inspectors come from a variety of mainly nuclear or high-hazard-related backgrounds, but all demonstrate calm and poise when working under pressure in one of the most demanding jobs in the public sector. Specific job-related expertise required alongside other technical and behavioural competencies for this specific discipline role are described below.In this case we are seeking to recruit Nuclear Safety Inspectors who specialise in Human Factors. Human Factors make a significant contribution to nuclear safety throughout a facility's lifecycle, and we are looking for experienced people with knowledge and understanding of safety cases and in particular how individual, team and organisational performance can impact upon nuclear safety. The scope of work is reflected in ONR's Safety Assessment Principles for Nuclear Facilities on Human Factors.We require credible people: With experience of the assessment and/or production of Human Factors safety cases/reports for the nuclear, high-hazard or highly-regulated industries; Who understand the relationship between Human Factors and other technical disciplines; Who are able to draw on engineering and safety analyses to inform their understanding of the human contribution to safety; With an ability to make sound judgements on the significance of Human Factors issues as they relate to overall risk; Who are able to influence licensees and other stakeholders.Extensive training will be provided on the legal and regulatory aspects of the role, along with opportunities to continue to develop, expand and deepen knowledge in the specialist area and on a range of nuclear technologies. In addition, there are opportunities for Human Factors Inspectors to support our Security and Transportation colleagues, using our Human Factors skills, knowledge and experience to provide specialist advice in relation to ONR’s wider purposes. As experience of regulating nuclear safety increases, all inspectors are given the opportunity to progress and potentially achieve promotion.\xa0Job descriptionPerson SpecificationONR is committed to being an inclusive employer and we welcome and encourage applications from all applicants.

If this sounds like an environment you would like to work in, we would love to hear from you.The Innovation Division is responsible for addressing one of the Department’s top Ministerial priorities – to increase the adoption of safe, ethical and effective innovations in the health and care system.It is a new function, established to set a compelling vision for innovation across the health and social care system, develop a clear strategy for achieving it, and coordinate delivery so the work gets done. It will address cross-cutting innovation policy questions through its projects team, promote and support a culture of innovation in the Department, and serve core briefing needs.We are looking to staff this function with a team of creative self-starters who build trusting relationships easily and know how to get things done.\xa0As a top Ministerial priority, it will have significant exposure to Ministers, the Department Board and the Department’s most senior officials.

You will shape your roles as senior leaders, to deliver high impact projects and activities that will maximise DHSC’s ability to achieve its Innovation objectives.The Innovation function has been established with the following five core objectives, and as members of senior leadership both roles will be key to defining this new programme of work, alongside a number of interested stakeholders:Clarify innovation priorities: The post holders will work closely together and alongside other key stakeholders across DHSC and its Arm’s Length Bodies to provide our policy teams, delivery partners and the wider health system with more clarity on the Department’s innovation priorities and turn this into an actionable and widely supported plan.Coordinate system efforts: The post holders will work closely together to align Ministers, senior officials, and senior delivery partners behind the Department’s plan and ensure they deliver the elements that they are responsible for. Oversee mapping of innovation challenges to prioritise and allocate responsibility for addressing any gaps in government provision.Solve cross-cutting innovation challenges: Lead creative approaches to solving high-priority innovation challenges which span several policy teams and therefore require central ownership, or where independent challenge is needed. Manage new priorities which emerge regularly and are driven by high levels of Ministerial interest. Promote and support a culture of innovation in the Department: Provide thought leadership, lead by example and create platforms to encourage innovative policy thinking across the Department’s grades and policy teams.Briefing: Oversight of all cross-cutting innovation commissions such as briefing for Department Board discussions, PQs and correspondence.Person specificationRole Responsibilities:Both post holders will need to be strong problem solvers and guide their teams effectively to balance their focus between short-term objectives and the long-term needs of the system. As this is a new function, both post holders will be expected to work closely with each other to actively shape their portfolios of work as they learn where their greatest contribution to the system lies. The split between the two roles is currently envisaged as the following, though there may be some need to stretch across boundaries to manage pressing requests:The Head of Innovation Strategy will focus on clarifying innovation priorities, coordinating system efforts and briefing. For example, they may lead a piece of work to identify which technologies are likely to be ‘game changing’ for the future health and social care system and how the Department should support their evolution.The Head of Innovation Projects will focus on cross-cutting innovation challenges and building a culture of innovation. For example, they may lead on a project to assess how the health and social care system could capture more of the value it generates for commercial organisations and in doing so better align incentives to support the development and adoption of innovation.These are critical leadership roles, so you will be expected to:Provide your team with a clear direction, coach them so they have the tools required to work independently, and give insightful feedback that supports their development.Take an active interest in understanding the diverse needs of colleagues and empower and trust your team to deliver.Be an exceptional problem solver so you can effectively guide your team where necessary and provide more hands-on ownership of work modules when they are particularly high profile or complex.Demonstrate an aptitude for thinking creatively and delivering effectively and collaboratively, and in doing so earn the respect of Ministers, senior officials and other partners.Play a leading role in shaping the work of the Division, including by intelligently identifying policy gaps and making the case to address them senior stakeholders.Whatever your background, we are looking for people who like getting things done, and who enjoy engaging others across the organisation in driving change.Key Skills and Experience:Essential: \xa0Leadership: You will be responsible for a new and wide brief that evolves regularly, so you will be a safe pair of hands, provide clarity to your team in the face of ambiguity, and have exceptional time management skills and attention to detail.

To achieve this, and create a great place to work, we have four values: we are inclusive, we constantly improve, we challenge, and we are agile. If this sounds like an environment you’d like to work in, we’d love to hear from you.The Adult Social Care (ASC) Group in DHSC leads on all matters relating to adult social care in the department. Putting social care on a sustainable footing, where everyone is treated with dignity and respect, is one of the biggest challenges that our society faces.A strong ASC workforce is the foundation for successful delivery of wider health, social care and economic priorities for Government. ASC is a huge employment sector in England (larger than the NHS) and yet faces high vacancies and retention challenges. Unlike the health sector, the NHS is not available to provide a meaningful and effective national response to systemic challenges.The Adult Social Care Workforce Strategy and Capacity Division is at the centre of a number of high profile Government priorities, including: leading brand new policy responses to significant political interest in managing immediate health and social care system capacity concerns; working with Cabinet Office, DWP and other Departments to address labour market shortages in key sectors; and looking to the future, building on recently announced policies , scoping new policies that will deliver on the Government’s pledge.We are looking for 3 SEOs to pick-up and lead cross-cutting, new and dynamic policies to deliver against Ministerial objectives.\xa0 This is a fantastic opportunity to work right at the heart of a major Government priority. By working together in a tight-knit, inclusive division, often in a fast-paced environment that requires initiative, we can embed real change in a key public sector.Diversity and inclusion are two of our biggest priorities and we recognise they are a work in progress. We aim to establish a workforce which reflects the society we serve, and DHSC welcomes applications from all. We are especially interested to hear from gender diverse, disabled, LGBT+ candidates, and candidates from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds. We view flexible working and inclusive leadership as essential for all our employees.Job descriptionThe Adult Social Care Workforce Strategy and Capacity Division is at the centre of a number of high-profile Government priorities.

What were the\u202fTasks? What\u202fAction\u202fdid you take?\u202f What were the Results of your actions?StrengthsIt is difficult to prepare for strength type questions. However, you can think through your answers, focus on your achievements and aspects you enjoy and decide how these can be applied in the organisation and role.\xa0While strengths questions are shorter and we do not expect a full STAR response, the panel is interested in your first reaction to the question and information or reasoning to support this.If you do not have work-based examples then please give examples from school/college, clubs, volunteering or other activities you have been involved in.\xa0\xa0\xa0If you withdraw your application at any stage, it will not be progressed any further.\u202f\xa0Stage 3 – Offer Once all interviews have been completed, candidates will be notified of the outcome by email.

Annualised hours agreements are reviewed at least annually.The annualised hours year runs from 1 April to 31 March.\xa0 If an individual begins working on an annualised hours basis part way through the year, they will receive a part-year agreement and the Annualised Hours Allowance will be pro-rated for the remainder of the year to reflect that agreement.If you transfer to a non-AHW post the requirement to work in accordance with the terms of the AHW policy will also end, and you will move to standard Home Office Terms and Conditions.The initial rate payable is 18.12%Age: These are shift working roles and so you must be 18 years or over.Flexible workingWhere business needs allow, some roles may be suitable for a combination of office and home-based working.\u202f This is a non-contractual arrangement where all employees will be expected to spend a minimum of 60% of their working time in an office, subject to local estates capacity, by Spring 2024.

There are many different approaches you could take to writing behaviours, such as the STAR, or the CAR method. As to which one you chose to use, it’s all down to your personal style of writing. Within the Civil Service, the most common approach is: The STAR method.\xa0Using the STAR method, allows you to set the scene, show what and how you did and the overall outcome.

The job holder will be looking for information of what you did, how you did it and why. Keep the focus on you. What specific steps did you take and what was your contribution? Remember to include how you did it, and the behaviours you used. Try to use “I” rather than “we” to explain your actions that lead to the result. Be careful not to take credit of something that you did not do.\xa0Results - Don’t be shy about taking credit for your behaviour. Quote specific facts and figures easily understandable.\xa0What results did the actions produce?What did you achieve through your actions and did you meet your goals?Was it a successful outcome? If not what did you learn from the experience?Keep the situation and task parts brief. Concentrate on the action and the result. If the result was not entirely successful describe what you learned from this and what you would do differently next time.
