We are making substantial investments in new digital technologies and skills to enhance our regulatory processes and management of informationJob descriptionWithin the Office for Nuclear Regulation, Fault Studies is the application of deterministic and probabilistic analysis / arguments within safety case submissions to demonstrate the safety of a nuclear facility following a postulated initiating event.A typical accident fault sequence analysed might be a loss of coolant accident on a Pressurised Water Reactor (PWR). To understand this accident requires good knowledge of reactor kinetics, heat transfer and fluid dynamics and how major system components behave and interact with one another under severe changes of pressure and temperature.The challenge is to understand the behaviour of a plant under a wide range of fault conditions using deterministic safety analysis techniques, most of which require the application of complex computer codes. Therefore, fault studies specialists need to have a very good understanding of the underlying science (in this case neutronics, fluid dynamics and heat transfer) and how the science is used through the application of computer codes to predict the plant's behaviour in during a transient.For other nuclear facilities, experience in Chemical Process Engineering, preferably nuclear but at least Tier 1 COMAH, would normally be a pre-requisite, with a considerable part of that experience having been applied to analysis of high hazard facilities under fault conditions.Principal ResponsibilitiesNuclear Inspectors are expected to be capable of undertaking a variety of roles:Inspecting sites.Assessing technical safety cases.Enforcing the law.Influencing safety improvements.Investigating incidents.Participating in emergency exercises.Developing strategic approaches to secure high standards in the industry.Managing nuclear research contracts.Developing and maintaining internal guidance.The role of a Nuclear Inspector is varied, and you are likely to undertake a range of duties during your career. Some Inspectors concentrate on undertaking planned and reactive inspections on site, while others will mainly assess safety submissions or manage discrete intervention projects. The ability to communicate effectively with a wide range of stakeholders internally and externally both verbally and in writing is an essential attribute.The focus is on working as part of multi-disciplinary teams to ensure compliance with the law, reassure the public and improve safety standards. When Inspectors find shortcomings in compliance, they initially provide advice but may take formal enforcement action if appropriate. The powers available to inspectors enable them to serve Enforcement Notices and ultimately initiate prosecutions. There is also a wide range of powers available under nuclear license conditions.Our inspectors come from a variety of mainly nuclear or high-hazard backgrounds, but all demonstrate composure when working at pace whilst undertaking an exacting and rewarding job in the public sector.Specific job-related expertise required alongside other technical and behavioural competencies for this specific discipline role are described below.Line Management ResponsibilitiesNone currently, however, at this level there could be an expectation to manage staff in the future.Person specificationLocation / Travel This post may be undertaken from a base at any one of ONR’s office locations (Bootle, Cheltenham or London).ONR operates hybrid working (working in the office and or at home) as part of our flexible working policy.\xa0 There is an expectation that everyone will spend time in the office on a regular basis, recognising that some work is better done face to face.
