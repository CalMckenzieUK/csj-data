Then read on! The Clean Green Infrastructure (CGI) team in the Department for Business & Trade (DBT) is recruiting a Senior Executive Officer role, which offers the chance to work at the intersection of trade, sustainability and development.\xa0\xa0DBT is the department for economic growth. We support businesses to invest, grow and export, including by bringing their expertise and technology to the global market.

The CGI approach aims to open new opportunities for UK solutions to be deployed in international infrastructure programmes.\xa0\xa0The CGI team sit within DBT’s Sustainability & Infrastructure Directorate. We work with governments and businesses in emerging markets, to support the development of sustainable infrastructure in such countries and increase opportunities for UK companies to deliver that infrastructure. Our work spans a range of infrastructure sectors, from energy, resilience and mining to transport, water, construction and social infrastructure.\xa0The team has a small programme budget to fund projects, but also works alongside key development initiatives, including the UK’s British Investment Partnerships, the multilateral Just Energy Transition Partnerships and the G7’s Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment.\xa0This role offers an excellent opportunity to engage and influence across a range of infrastructure sectors and different parts of the infrastructure ecosystem. You would work closely with international counterparts, industry and other parts of the UK Government, all to support the development of sustainable infrastructure and related UK export opportunities in developing markets.\xa0\xa0You would also lead efforts (on behalf of DBT’s wider Infrastructure team) to strengthen our collaboration with UK Export Finance (UKEF). As our export credit agency, UKEF provides export finance to overseas buyers of UK goods and services, and is often a key enabler of UK participation in delivering infrastructure overseas. Our vision is that early-stage support from CGI will help to increase the attractiveness of UKEF as a financing partner for the delivery of infrastructure projects overseas, drawing in substantial exports from the UK supply chain. Your contribution to DBT-UKEF collaboration will help to maximise the impact of the Government toolkit and increase the export of UK technology and services into international infrastructure.Job descriptionWork collaboratively across DBT and wider UK Government to open new markets for UK commercial involvement in sustainable infrastructure, by developing and delivering programmes of targeted activities in specific market(s).\xa0\xa0Deploy strategic thinking to make sense of complex and often uncertain pictures. This includes drawing on diverse information and policy tools to: (a) match other countries’ infrastructure needs with UK industry capabilities; (b) identify and implement short-term initiatives for UK Government support to open doors for UK commercial participation in sustainable infrastructure overseas; and (c) develop an environment that enables long-term UK business involvement and exports in the sustainable infrastructure market. It also entails contributing to CGI strategic discussions, such as regarding future priority markets or team strategy.\xa0\xa0\xa0Lead CGI implementation in at least one priority market. You would develop an in-depth understanding of infrastructure opportunities, identify and design CGI projects, and ensure they are procured and implemented on time and in budget. You would also develop related engagement plans, provide light-touch support to embassy colleagues, monitor and evaluate programme performance, and contribute to formal reporting, lessons learned and the adoption of best practice.\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0Strengthen DBT’s collaboration with UKEF on international infrastructure opportunities, including by aligning CGI interventions with future opportunities for UKEF to finance infrastructure delivery and construction, and by supporting senior leaders to develop alignment on other strategic priorities.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0Develop strong relationships with industry, trade bodies and internal sector specialists; undertake account management responsibilities; and articulate UK capabilities to a range of audiences – all to ensure our projects link back to tangible support for UK export opportunities (the central goal of our work).\xa0Throughout your work, collaborate closely with diverse stakeholders, including to understand the landscape of priority markets, influence the emergence of opportunities, support pursuit of mutual goals, and ensure that projects reflect emerging and current export objectives. These stakeholders include a range of UK Government colleagues –such as overseas embassies, trade policy teams, sector specialists, UKEF, the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office and other departments – plus counterparts in other governments, programme delivery partners and industry.\xa0Provide briefings or submissions on CGI projects and/or DBT-UKEF collaboration – including, where necessary, to senior officials or Ministers.\xa0Play an active role in developing team culture – within the CGI team and across the wider Sustainability & Infrastructure Directorate.\xa0Person specificationEssential Criteria\xa0\xa0Excellent communication skills – for example, the ability to communicate (whether in writing, speaking or when presenting) in a clear, confident and persuasive manner to a range of audiences (including colleagues, industry representatives or other government stakeholders, at varying levels of seniority).\xa0\xa0Excellent influencing skills – for example, ability to manage, collaborate with and persuade senior stakeholders from industry and government.\xa0Strong ability to work autonomously – including ability to be proactive in finding solutions, self-motivate, develop your own evidence-based positions and drive forward projects.\xa0\xa0Strong leadership and organisational skills – including working to tight deadlines and managing uncertainty or competing priorities.\xa0Desirable Criteria\xa0\xa0Knowledge or experience of infrastructure or the financing of infrastructure.\xa0Knowledge or experience of the sustainability/clean growth agenda.\xa0Knowledge or experience of business development, trade and investment.\xa0Experience of working internationally or with international partners.\xa0Personal Attributes & Skills\xa0We are looking for candidates who:\xa0Are collaborative and excel at working with others in pursuit of shared goals.\xa0Have a commercial mindset and would enjoy the challenge of balancing working across Whitehall on Government priorities with our focus on delivering commercial outcomes for the UK economy.\xa0Are excellent communicators and influencers, able to persuade others and ‘find ways through’ to enable agreement of key outcomes.\xa0Are strong strategic thinkers, who can make sense of complex or uncertain pictures, and who would enjoy the work of finding synergies between the bespoke infrastructure needs of other countries and the capabilities of UK industry.\xa0\xa0Are responsive and adaptable, comfortable working at pace and with ambiguity, and able to overcome setbacks and motivate those around them.\xa0Are effective project managers, who use appropriate approaches to deliver despite competing deadlines and priorities.\xa0Behaviours We'll assess you against these behaviours during the selection process: Seeing the Big Picture", 'Working Together', 'Communicating and Influencing', 'BenefitsAlongside your salary of £39,384, Department for Business and Trade contributes', '             £10,633 towards you being a member of the Civil Service Defined Benefit Pension scheme.', '             ', "             Find out what benefits a Civil Service Pension provides.Learning and development tailored to your roleAn environment with flexible working optionsA culture encouraging inclusion and diversityA Civil Service pension with an average employer contribution of 27%We recognise the challenges that people with (multiple) protected characteristics may experience on the job market and in their career progression.

This means these assets are often undervalued or implicitly valued at zero, potentially leading to suboptimal decisions around whether to invest in or preserve them.\xa0Therefore, DCMS are developing a formal approach to valuation called Cultural and Heritage Capital (CHC), to address this gap in the evidence to measure the full social and economic impact of culture and heritage.\xa0In January 2021, DCMS formally launched the CHC Framework, setting out our approach to valuing the benefits provided by culture and heritage assets. Eventually, we will publish supplementary guidance in the Green Book following the example of the environment sector and the natural capital approach, as well as a set of national culture and heritage capital accounts.Since then, a £3.1m joint AHRC/DCMS Research Call has commenced, as well as many pieces of research and analysis within DCMS and its ALBs, for instance measuring the economic value of museums and galleries digital offers, available on the CHC Portal.\xa0You will support with the analytical / research needs of the Culture and Heritage Capital (CHC) team, providing input into novel and sophisticated economic and econometric analysis, including stated and revealed preferences, as well as producing guidance and methodology notes for use in social cost benefit analysis.\xa0This role is a real opportunity to make a significant contribution to economic theory and more specifically the field of cultural economics, and also contribute to high profile projects, potentially becoming a named author on published documents that will form the foundations of the project for years to come.The role will require the candidate to manage a quality service to effectively lead research and produce high quality outputs (for instance Contingent Valuation or Hedonic analysis of CHC assets), but also see the bigger picture and make effective decisions to prepare a robust and compelling evidence base and case for intervention in longer term research and priorities, alongside our ALBs.You will also be required to effectively communicate complex economic concepts to non-specialists, to maximise the impact and visibility of analysis and ensure policy colleagues and cultural organisations fully understand the analysis.While the focus is on Culture and Heritage Capital, you will play a proactive role in the AHT spoke and the wider analytical community across DCMS. You should be able to work together to think strategically about the role of evidence and analysis within the wider policy space, and link up with other areas across DCMS.\xa0Job descriptionKey responsibilities:Conduct and manage economic and econometric research, including contingent valuation and hedonic pricing, to be published on the CHC Portal.Design, commission and manage economic research projects with consultants (e.g. Frontier Economics), that demonstrate the value and impact of culture and heritage, for instance the impact on health and wellbeing of engagement with culture and heritage.Work closely with economists at our partner organisations, including Historic England and the Arts Council to progress some of the key methodological questions in cultural economics.Engage with world leading academics and experts on arts, humanities and economics to improve the robustness, visibility and impact of CHC analysis.Communicate and disseminate research findings to key audiences, including the CHC Advisory Board, presenting findings in innovative and impactful ways, including reports, graphics, or speaking at conferences and seminars.Help promote CHC across the department and government, and play an active role in the wider DCMS analytical team, to seek opportunities for collaboration in analysis and research to achieve synergies across sectors.Person specificationThe ideal candidate would have the following key skills and experience:Essential Requirements:Badged membership of the Government Economic Service, or eligibility to become a member.

It does this across the corporate, policy and delivery parts of the department. For example, the directorate works with the DESNZ Finance team to provide effective coordination on fiscal events and processes; runs strategic projects on cross-cutting policy issues, and; brings together and tracks the delivery of the entire energy portfolio.\xa0\xa0 We are recruiting for roles to sit in our Strategy Development team, working on: Strategic policy priorities: this could include projects relating to our Power Sector Decarbonisation targets, Geospatial planning and other cross-cutting energy policy issues.

Support the development, delivery and launch of important departmental documents and publications (such as the Energy Security Plan and the Strategic Spatial Energy Plan) – many of which will draw input from right across the department and beyond, and which will form major government moments.Respond to reports by Parliamentary committees and influential sector players such as the Committee on Climate Change on the development of the UK energy system, and support reporting on progress to the various net zero and energy governance boards.\xa0 This will involve working closely with colleagues in the governance teams to ensure that the Directorate’s briefings, advice notes and responses include strong, strategically informed advice.Bring the department’s work together to deliver time-limited projects in specific areas that affect multiple sectors, by building and strong working relationships with policy teams, analysts, project delivery professionals and other experts, coordinating different strands of work to deliver particular objectives, and creating appropriate and fit-for-purpose delivery arrangements for these pieces of work.Skills and experienceExperience of energy policy is preferred - but we are open to candidates who have enthusiasm to learn, and evidence of the following skills:\xa0\xa0 Seeing the big picture is at the heart of this role: you will be able to draw the many strands of policy together, with an eye on wider events, as well as the political landscape and upcoming challenges.\xa0 Strategy team plays a major part in the delivery of some of the most important actions in the department, and you will be the first port of call.\xa0 Communication & influencing – the strategy team works because we stay close to a wide range of experts in policy teams and further afield, and you will need to be able to forge these quick and effective working links, and to communicate sometimes complex and nuanced issues in a clear and effective way.

We need to be able to take considered, defensible decisions at pace, at times with incomplete information, that will drive forward the progress of the portfolio.Delivering at pace – we live at the centre of the action, serving the immediate needs of Ministers and senior leaders, and the ability to quickly cut through to the essential actions, and work with an ever-changing mix of colleagues and partners to make things happen will be important.

There are many different approaches you could take to writing behaviours, such as the STAR, or the CAR method. As to which one you chose to use, it’s all down to your personal style of writing. Within the Civil Service, the most common approach is: The STAR method\xa0Using the STAR method, allows you to set the scene, show what and how you did and the overall outcome. The job holder (and later the interviewer) will use this method to gather all the relevant information about a specific capability that the job requires.\xa0Situation - Describe the situation you found yourself in. You must describe a specific event or situation. Be sure to give enough detail for the job holder to understand.\xa0Where are you?\xa0Who was there with you?\xa0What had happened?\xa0Task - The job holder will want to understand what you tried to achieve from the situation you found yourself in.\xa0What was the task that you had to complete and why?\xa0What did you have to achieve?\xa0Actions - What did you do? The job holder will be looking for information of what you did, how you did it and why. Keep the focus on you. What specific steps did you take and what was your contribution? Remember to include how you did it, and the behaviours you used. Try to use “I” rather than “we” to explain your actions that lead to the result. Be careful not to take credit of something that you did not do.\xa0Results - Don’t be shy about taking credit for your behaviour. Quote specific facts and figures easily understandable.\xa0What results did the actions produce?\xa0What did you achieve through your actions and did you meet your goals?\xa0Was it a successful outcome? If not what did you learn from the experience?\xa0Keep the situation and task parts brief. Concentrate on the action and the result. If the result was not entirely successful describe what you learned from this and what you would do differently next time. Make sure you focus on your strengths.\xa0Remember- if you are a school leaver or out of employment, and feel that you don’t have the experience to apply for this role then do this-\xa0Make a list of your skills, strength and experience\xa0Focus on your education/day-to-day life/extra-curricular activities such as team sports\xa0Highlight anything that would help you perform in the job that you are applying for.Please ensure that at the application and interview stages of the campaign you review the Success Profiles Framework to assist you in the demonstration of your skills and experience.Your suitability for the role will be assessed using the Success Profile elements that have been chosen for this campaign.
