This gives details of Hybrid working, working patterns and terms and conditions of employment.Please note that successful part time and job share candidates may be required to work full time for specific periods to complete and consolidate training. Currently training can last for up to 6 weeks for which you may be required to work full time. Hybrid Working will not commence until the training / consolidation period has been successfully completed.Stage 2 - Interview Those who pass the Written Application sift with the required score will be invited to a blended interview and will receive an electronic notification to your Civil Service Jobs account. Please note that interviews will be via video using Microsoft Teams and you will need to use your personal or work device to access the video link. You will receive a link to join the interview at the appointed time through the email account you provide us with on your application.\xa0 Interviews are scheduled to take place from 08/01/2024, please note that this date is only indicative at this stage and could be subject to change. Interviews will be scheduled Monday to Friday, between 09:00 to 17:00.Communications will be electronic and/or by telephone therefore it is vitally important that you check your Civil Service Jobs account regularly, as well as your spam/junk email folder. Telephone calls may show as a withheld number, it is important that you answer so that your interview can be confirmed. \xa0 Preparing for the interview The interview will take approximately between 30 and 40 minutes where you will be asked a mixture of Behavioural and Strength questions.\xa0 A blended interview aims to be more of a conversation at interview offering a more inclusive approach.\xa0The Strength and Behaviour based questioning explores what the candidate can and has done, but also their potential.\xa0\xa0 BehavioursYou will be assessed against the Civil Service Behaviours listed above at Level 1. To help you prepare and settle into the interview you will be sent the behaviour questions in advance of the interview. These questions should be treated as confidential and should not be shared. The interview panel may ask you other questions which will not be shared in advance, including follow-up questions, and those about your strengths.An example of a Behavioural question would be - “Tell me about a time when you’ve had to deal with a difficult customer.”It may help to use one or more examples of a piece of work you have completed or a situation you have been in and use the WHO or STAR model to explain:\xa0\xa0\xa0  WHO - What\xa0it was,\xa0how\xa0you approached the work/situation and what the\xa0Outcomes\xa0were, what did you\xa0achieve? or STAR - What was the\xa0Situation? That were the\xa0Tasks? What\xa0Action\xa0did you take?\xa0 What were the Results of your actions?StrengthsIt is difficult to prepare for strength type questions. However, you can think through your answers, focus on your achievements and aspects you enjoy and decide how these can be applied in the organisation and role. While strengths questions are shorter and we do not expect a full STAR response, the panel is interested in your first reaction to the question and information or reasoning to support this.If you do not have work-based examples then please give examples from school/college, clubs, volunteering or other activities you have been involved in.\xa0\xa0 The evidence you provide in your interview must relate to your own thoughts and experiences. If you withdraw your application at any stage, it will not be progressed any further.\xa0Stage 3 – OfferOnce all interviews have been completed, candidates will be notified of the outcome by email. Offers will be made in strict merit order to the highest scoring candidates first.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0The successful candidate(s) will be notified of a start date following successful security checks, which is likely to be during February/March 2024.Reserve ListYou will be placed on the reserve list if your application is successful, but we cannot immediately offer you a post.The reserve list may be held for a period of 3 months from which further appointments can be made.Please note:\xa0  If you accept an offer of a post, you will be expected to withdraw from any other live campaigns you have applied for, with DWP, at that grade.\xa0 If you are offered the role you applied for, in a location you have expressed a preference for, and you decline the offer or are unable to take up post within a reasonable timeframe you will be withdrawn from the campaign and removed from the reserve list, other than in exceptional circumstances*.\xa0\xa0 If DWP makes an offer of an alternative role or location to that which you originally applied for, and you decline that offer, you will be able to remain on the reserve list.\xa0*Note -\xa0Exceptional circumstances could be when a candidate has requested a contractual Part Time Working Pattern and this pattern cannot be accommodated in the initial role offered, or in cases of serious ill health.
