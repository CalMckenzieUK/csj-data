They have brought a range of benefits, including increased choice for consumers and income for individual homeowners and local economies. However, concerns have also been raised about the impact on local housing, and about inconsistencies within the regulatory framework for guest accommodation.\xa0The government recently consulted on how to implement a registration scheme for short-term lets. Such a scheme will ensure that we reap the benefits of a diverse and sustainable visitor accommodation offer and support the visitor economy - whilst also protecting local communities, including ensuring the availability of affordable housing to rent or to buy.

However, workforce shortages and skills gaps are threat which could limit this growth. These two issue are longstanding but have been exacerbated by the impact of Covid-19 and changes to legal migration frameworks since leaving the European Union.The visitor economy is a diverse sector, offering a range of rewarding jobs from entry level bar/restaurant management to CEO of a global hotel group. Tourism employs a high number of young people and women, and is one of the most socially mobile sectors. However, the industry suffers from a perception of being a ‘stepping stone’ industry.

We provide legal advice to Government Departments on matters that are frequently scrutinised in Parliament and the media. Our advisory clients range from Departments such as the Home Office, the Department for International Trade to the Department for Health and the Ministry of Defence, to name just a few. Whether you join us as an advisory, employment, commercial or litigation lawyer, we offer broad and unrivalled career opportunities. We would be thrilled to receive applications from candidates whatever stage you are at in your legal career. Whether you are newly qualified, returning to work after a break, or looking to ‘do something different’, GLD is a supportive and happy place to work.Job descriptionWhile previous experience or knowledge may be relevant to some vacancies, Government work is likely to involve a rapid learning curve to acquire legal skills and knowledge not required in private practice. Strong intellectual and analytical skills are important. We will provide support to help you acquire the necessary expertise and have a thriving CPD-accredited in-house training programme. GLD encourages its people to develop their skills and provides opportunities to move between advisory, litigation, employment and commercial law services during their careers. For Newly Qualified lawyers with under one year’s experience, GLD operates a ‘2+2’ policy, whereby these lawyers are allocated to two, 2 year postings over their first 4 years working with GLD; 2 years in a contentious team (litigation or employment), and a further 2 years in a non-contentious advisory post, or vice-versa. The scheme is intended to help NQs to develop a broader range of skills and stay ‘fresh’ in working on different areas of law and in new environments.\xa0Areas of Law\xa0Litigation Group\xa0The actions and decisions of Government are under increasing scrutiny in the Courts: immigration policy, welfare reform, climate change and energy policy, Covid, and military action overseas are just a few of the issues that generate legal challenges that regularly hit the headlines. GLD litigation lawyers conduct a wide range of cases which are often high profile and frequently involve questions of constitutional and societal importance. Our cases regularly go all the way to the Supreme Court and are at the forefront of law as it develops.\xa0Our public law litigation practice covers the full range of judicial review challenges in areas such as planning, the environment, prisons, immigration, and national security as well as the Government’s wide ranging reform agenda. We also have a substantial private law practice representing Government Departments including the Ministry of Justice, Department of Work and Pensions, and the Ministry of Defence in personal injury, clinical negligence, misfeasance in public office, false imprisonment, and other claims as well as inquests.\xa0 Litigation lawyers also provide expert representation in public inquiries, including the Covid Inquiry.\xa0Our litigators gain early responsibility for their own caseload within a supportive team environment. They work in collaboration with counsel from the Attorney General’s Panels and play an important co-ordination role when litigation involves several Government Departments.\xa0 Litigation lawyers also work closely with policy colleagues and advisory legal colleagues in client departments to reduce the exposure to legal risk and to develop realistic contingency plans when litigation risk materialises.\xa0Our litigation is some of the most interesting and challenging there is and provides an excellent opportunity to work at the heart of government law.Advisory Divisions\xa0Government Departments need to draw on the skills of advisory lawyers to bring to life policies for which Ministers are accountable to Parliament and the electorate. The legal issues are often complex, novel and politically sensitive.\xa0 The legal approach may be scrutinised by Parliament, the media, courts, and other institutions, domestic and international. Projects are often fast moving, and the problems brought to lawyers are often both urgent and unpredictable. Our advisory lawyers work collaboratively and as part of the same team with policy officials and other professionals in the Departments we advise to find legally sound solutions to deliver Ministers’ priorities, even where this change overnight.Ministers often want to reform and improve the area they are responsible for. They are likely to be brimming with ideas about how to change things – more affordable childcare, planning regulations which support the growth agenda, ensuring access to banking services, and restricting the activities of hostile state actors in the UK, are some recent examples. Advisory lawyers think through all the legal implications of a policy, for instance human rights, international legal obligations, equality and data protection issues, as well as core public law principles. They need to anticipate possible legal challenges and provide officials and Ministers with clear legal risk assessments. If a challenge is made they will instruct colleagues from Litigation Group and provide the interface with Departmental officials and Ministers.Unlike other in-house lawyers, our advisory lawyers create and write the law as well as applying existing law.\xa0 Where new primary legislation is required, advisory lawyers work with Parliamentary Counsel on the draft Bill and support policy colleagues and Ministers at all stages of the parliamentary process. Another strand of work involves international negotiations, where our lawyers may be involved in advising on or directly participating in negotiations, such as trade agreements or multilateral environmental treaties.\xa0Advisory lawyers also implement policy reforms and Acts of Parliament by drafting a huge volume of secondary legislation. To write a new law is a special privilege, requiring both precision of expression and creativity. It is a team effort involving multiple checks, but the drafter will always have a special sense of pride and ownership.Commercial Law Group\xa0The Commercial Law Group (CLG) celebrates its 10th anniversary in 2024 and its reputation across government as a unified expert commercial law service continues to go from strength to strength. CLG is looking for able, pro-active lawyers at any stage in their career who seek to be involved at the forefront of public commercial law, and wish to make a difference to society. CLG offers unrivalled commercial legal work. Our people work on some of the most high profile, complex and far-reaching projects in government for most Departments of State and other public bodies .The group consists of seven transactional teams, a litigation/dispute resolution team, and two property law teams. CLG is a national organisation, operating out of offices in Manchester, Leeds, Bristol and London, as well as being located with some clients in London and near Bristol.The Group has wellbeing and diversity at its core, offers real career progression within commercial law, and provides a second to none training offer to its staff\xa0Employment\xa0The GLD Employment Group is right at the heart of delivering key legal services to Government. There are approximately 160 people in the division. We have 8 client facing legal teams and a dedicated business and litigation support team. We have offices in Bristol, Leeds, London, and Manchester.\xa0We provide an expert service delivering value for money for the public purse. We act for all Government Departments and their agencies including Cabinet Office, HM Treasury, HMRC, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Defence, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, Home Office, Department of Education, Department for Transport, Department for Work and Pensions, Department for Business and Trade, DCMS and DLUHC.\xa0 We advise on all aspects of Civil Service employment from the individual e.g., internal grievances and disciplinary proceedings, discrimination, tribunal claims etc to the cross-cutting policy issues of the day – e.g. equal pay, terms and conditions of service, worker/employee status, industrial relations. We also act in National Security cases. Much of the work we do is unique to GLD. The interest and range of work undertaken is second to none – we handle litigation up to the Supreme Court and provide employment advice in the context of Ministers’ political and operational drivers.\xa0\xa0The specialist TUPE Hub advises all government departments on the employment law aspects of commercial insourcing and outsourcing contracts, as well as on reorganisations within the Civil Service and wider public sector.\xa0 This includes advice on the applicability of TUPE/COSOP, tender and contractual documents, negotiations and consultations, pensions and post-transfer harmonisation and other employment issues.\xa0\xa0The specialist Industrial Relations Hub advises across the Civil Service on industrial relations and trade union legal matters affecting Government departments themselves and the public services for which Government is responsible. We work closely with other legal teams across GLD.\xa0\xa0We are an incredibly friendly and supportive division offering full training and support, with opportunities for career progression as an employment expert or as part of your cross GLD career portfolio.\xa0\xa0\xa0One GLD\xa0If you apply, please note that your application will be for a generalist qualified lawyer role at the Government Legal Department.
